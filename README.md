# Milestone-Project-One

Milestone project. 

Needs to be interactive.
Needs to be simple. 
Most of it should be your own code, do not use librarys unless its just to pull data or free images.

ideas:

search and find game like where's waldo
- have multiple html files for the different scenes
- main background image
- smaller images to find (more later)
- a timer
- a list of names of items to find (or number of the same item)
- a score keeper
- Congratulations you did it alert/screen
    -- images in an array, if clicked then add marker of some kind, 
    -- when all images have marker, you win
    -- use a for/if loop to go through the array of images.
- try again
- ability to click on items and have them removed from the main image div
- when images are removed have them move to the "bank", have the matching image marked out, and/or have a counter
- have a starting window with a start button 


Bonus items:

- settings button for music and sound effects 
- easy, medium, and hard: type of photo, number of items, faster time?
- lose points when wrong item is clicked on

    - check for overlap of images
    - make the scene height and width responsive
    - using the responsive height and width of the background scene, add the limits of the images to be added to the scene
    - create a welcome page
    - create a try again area on the screen instead of a window alert
    - create a you won window on the screen. create buttons to continue or to go back to main menu
