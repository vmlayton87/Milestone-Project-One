# Milestone-Project-One

Milestone project. 

Needs to be interactive.
Needs to be simple. 
Most of it should be your own code, do not use librarys unless its just to pull data or free images.

ideas:
Hi low card game
what does not belong
matching/memory game
hangman
what's next for the box method
what's next for doing inequality math problems (can get them from my own math books, or from MVP)
