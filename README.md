# Milestone-Project-One

Milestone project for Software development bootcamp: Web Browser Game

## About:

This application is meant for younger children. The target age range is 5 to 10 years of age. 

The main point of this game is to find select images in a larger scenery. The images to be found are randomly genereated from a list and the position of the images in the scenery are randomly generated.

### Basic Functions:

- There is an opener page where you can click on a start link that goes to forest.html
- Everytime forest.html is accessed or refreshed the items you have to find are randomly generated, as is the position of the items in the scene. 
- When you find a correct item, it is removed from the scene, and a check mark is placed next to the list item.
- When you find all five items, a window alert tells you that you have found all items.
